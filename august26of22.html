            i woke up at around 10.30, which is actually one of my best times, considering that some days during the summer
            i woke up at 1.

            i had paneer kulcha for brunch. its a flatbread stuffed with paneer. i had the frozen kulcha, which needed to be heated up.
            however, i didnt heat it up properly. its supposed to be heated on a stove with oil and all for 5 minutes, but i didn't even leave it 
            on the pan for a minute or two. so it ended up being hard in the center and soft on the outside. and when i tried 
            throwing it in the microwave instead of putting it back on the pan, the entire kulcha became hard ._, i inflicted it upon myself ig.

            i went to my friends house for her mini birthday celebration went with my sister in the afternoon. we had pastries and tea;
            the pastries were from Sook Pastry, and they were delicious! i never truly appreciated fruit tarts until i had their peach 
            tart, i will be eating more in the future lol. i had it with raspberry tea, which i found to be quite strong in flavor. but im not
            a big fan of faint tea flavors either, i will need to experiment more in terms of tea flavors and brands to find
            which ones arent too strong or bland. regardless, i had a great time with my friend and sister; we were chatting about school and life
            in general.

            shortly afterwards, i went biking to my old elementary school. its a nice area, with a big playground, and plenty of space to bike around
            in. i went behind the school and to the baseball field. the sand was nice and even, with the white lines of sand laid down and everything. 
            there was also dude there who was practicing lacross nearby, by using his little net-with-a-handle to throw a ball against a brick wall.  
            he was probably doing that for hours before i came by; he looked really sweaty and tired. must have been working hard to pass try-outs or smn.

            after spending some time at the school, i biked up to a farm next to the school. there were a lot of people when i came; it looked like there was
            some sort of birthday party for some little kids. I quickly bought myself an apple flavored snapple and headed home.

            that was all i did today. this was the most i have ever been outside this past month oml. hopefully i can go out more when school starts,
            as september to november are the best months for going outside imo.
