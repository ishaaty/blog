        <h1>12/26/22 - nyc</h1>
        <p>
            belated feliz navidad! because i hadnt gone to nyc since july, i begged my mommy to take me, and she agreed lol.
        </p>
        <p>
            yesterday she told me i needed to bundle up, because the weather was going to be freezing today. i really didnt think it was going to be
            that bad, but it was.
        </p>
        <p>
            we arrived at the train station at around 7.20 am, and we went on nj transit to secaucus, and from there we took another train to penn station. we 
            arrived there at around 8.30 am.
        </p>
        <p>
            penn station was interesting; the whole place smelled, but i distinctly remember this guy kept calling out for a guy called Michael. 
            he probably yelled out his name 30 times in a minute. i hope he found Michael.
        </p>

            after leaving penn, my mom and i were walking along 7th avenue, and we stumbled upon Andrews NYC Diner. we went in to have breakfast, and it was delicious!
            i had a bagel with creamcheese and a fruit cup (so exquisite ik) and my mom had an omelette. the servers there were very friendly and attentive, which was nice.
        </p>
        <p>
            after eating, we headed up to times square. this is when the cold started kicking it; it was below 20 degrees, so i started wearing my scarf as a mask. i really
            thought that living in nj for 13 years of my life would have helped me cope with the freezing weather, but i guess not. 
        </p>
        <p>
            times square is actually really nice: when it's less crowded. it was fun looking at the colorful ads, and we also sat on the steps used to watch the ball drop.
        </p>
        <p>
            shortly my mom and i left for central park, and we made a few pit stops along the way. we stopped at the rockafeller center and saw the tree and ice skating rink, 
            but my favorite stop was the riverside church. it was really pretty, and i was able to spit out my world history knowledge from ms. pagano's class to my mom about the vernacular
            and all. however, there were so many candles inside, that my mom started sneezing from the incense, so we couldnt stay long.
        </p>
        <p>
            when we arrived at central park, we bought hot chocolate from a vendor. it was so hot that my mom spent a solid 3 minutes pouring the hot chocolate
            from her cup into mine, my cup into hers, etc until it was cool enough to drink it. we quietly sipped on our drinks while watching pigeons fly around
            the frozen lake.
        </p>
        <p>
            we went to some cafe on 7th avenue for lunch. i got a turkey club sandwich, and my mom got a grilled chicken sandwich.
        </p>
        <p>
            everything else that happened after that is a blur. except, for when we were coming back home.
        </p>
        <p>
            mother and i were waiting in an extremely long line to go the bathroom at the train station. i had to go really badly, because i drank 5 bottles of water after lunch. however, there was a mother and her daughter cutting through everyone in line, with the mother screaming "EMERGENCY" and rushing inside. i was mad in the moment, but considering the daughter was 7 or so, it was ok :)
        </p>
        <p>
            fast forward to getting on the train, my mom and i found a nice little corner to relax in on the ride home. but that same mother daughter duo came and sat with us. i was planning on sleeping, but the mother kept screaming at her daughter on being more responsible and going to the bathroom when she needs to. welp. ok. yea.
        </p>
        <p> 
            mommy and i arrived home safe and sound.
