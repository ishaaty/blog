            hi guys.
        </p>
        <p>
            i left for india either one or two days ago. this was my first time going on a plane since 2019, and it was quite the experience. here are my thoughts that no one asked for.
        </p>
        <p>
            warning: this is the longest post i ever wrote lmfao
        </p>

            at 4pm on chewsday a limo came to pick up my family and i. at first i was quite worried for my limo driver because we had 10 huge suitcases
            which i was confident were going to block his rearview mirror. but it turns out he was one step ahead of us
            as his rearview mirror wasn't actually a mirror, but a camera located behind the car. it basically gives him a crystal clear view of behind
            the limo without having all the luggage crowding his vision. quite swell i have to say.
        </p>
        <p>
            after 1.5 hrs we arrived at the airport. it took forever to check in our check-in bags, but even after we finished doing that,
            the lady there told us that we were not allowed to have a backpack AND a carry-on suitcase; we could only have one or the other.
        </p>
        <p>
            my dad got pretty pissed off (internally), and we all ended up sacrificing our carry-on suitcases into check-in. it was tough,
            but we all got through it.
        </p>
        <p>
            we were all quite hungry after security, so we went to this self-ordering restaurant kinda thing. while i was waiting to pick up
            our food, an old man asked me to help him purchase one of his items. he wanted to buy a smoothie, but it was quite difficult for him
            because he had no idea where the scanner was on the ipad like device. tbh i had no clue either, but after a min i figured it out and helped
            him scan his smoothie. after scanning, the device prompted him to enter his name, to which he had a nervous breakdown because he didnt
            want the restaurant to find out his name or smn. i told him to put in a fake name, to which he told me that that
            was extremely dishonest of me to say and started scolding me. an employee noticed and helped him calm down, and with that i ran away with my food.

            fast forward to boarding time: this would be our first flight to dubai, and then later we would be heading to dehli. the way boarding works (at least for emirates) is that they call people to board in this order: first-class/business-class/special premium membership stuff/families w/infants and tiny children
            all get onto the aircraft, then people in sections C, D, E, and F board the plane in that order. we were in section D. 
            the reason i bring this up is because there was this guy who was double checking the boarding passes for all the people who were about to board,
            but for some reason, he was extremely suspicious of my family, and he made it extremely obvious. while we were waiting in line for section D to board, he repeated
            himself every 2 mins: he would announce "everyone in section D and section D ONLY may wait in line", and he even checked our boarding passes
            3 times to really make sure we were being honest (he did this with no other family lol). tbh it's hard to explain, but it was funny in the moment i promise.
        </p>
        <p>
            finally we boarded the plane, and it took off. it was a 15 hr plane ride woohoo. sleeping physically hurt my body, because i would
            end up resting my head on my mom's lap or my sister's sholder, which either hurt my neck or back lol. i also watched the srk movie "fan", 
            which was kinda sad ngl. 
        </p>
        <p>
            best part abt the flight hands down was this baby who was in the row in front of me. ik babies in planes are said to be awful, 
            but this baby was so cute oml. i remember there were times when he would peek at the row behind him (right where i was), and he would
            try to take my water bottle. i gave it to him because i had no use for it, but then i regretted doing it, because i saw him chewing
            on the bottle (it was plastic). luckily he dropped it on the floor and his mom took it away from him.
        </p>

            we finally landed in dubai, and that airport is probably the quiestest i have ever been to. there was no music, and the only time they
            did play music was smn in arabic, which wasn't that noisy anyway. i got some iced drink while i was there.
        </p>
        <p>
            we waited in a lounge before boarding our next flight. this time we were in section F (sob) so we were some of the last people to board.
            for some weird reason, there were 2 unconnected lines that were formed to the gateway towards the plane (like in a L shape). the guy who was there monitoring
            everyone who was going through the gateway told us to form one line, but there was a lady at the front of the opposite line we were in who was giving this guy a ton of crap for not 
            being fair, and only letting my line pass through. even after we got through, she was bothering another employee who was in the gateway for being lazy when he was just standing there.
            maybe he was tired and needed a break idk.
        </p>
        <p>
            3 hrs later we landed in dehli. we had to go to dehli duty free to buy chocolates and wine for some of our relatives, and before we knew it,
            we had 2 employees at the store assist us with buying our stuff. ik at the surface it seems super sweet, but these guys were only trying
            to get my parents to put things in the cart that we absolutely didn't need. we got a lot more chocolate and wine than we needed to get ._.
        </p>
        <p>
            while they were purchasing their things, my sister and i went to baggage claim to find our check-in bags. i made my sister stand by the carousel, and i waited 
            in the distance with our luggage cart and wtv luggage she found. there was one dude next to me who kept staring at me, which got me freaked out because firstly i was alone and secondly i thought
            he was gonna steal my luggage. i didnt want to take any chances so i found my dad and made him watch the luggage cart instead while i stood with my sister.
        </p>
        <p>
            was i acting paranoid? most definitely yes.
        </p>
        <p>
            welp we found all of our luggage (thankfully none got lost), and we found my aunt and uncle outside the airport waiting for us.
        </p>
        <p>
            it was 4:30 am when we got home. i just need to make sure that i don't fall asleep, otherwise i'm going to be jet-lagged for 
            the next 3 weeks, and that'll be no fun.
        </p>

            ciao.
