            hi guys. isha's back (after 2 months boo)
        </p>
        <p>
            welp i'm officially done w sophomore yr. the rest of my classmates are left to suffer until the 26th of june, while i have summer camp!
        </p>
        <p>
            the camp im doing rn is called Kode With Klossy (kwk), and i've had a lot of fun so far! it's great meeting other scholars who are also interested in cs while also learning about mobile app dev.
        </p>

            as for my personal life, my mom and sister left for texas this morning at 3am. so the noise level at that time was truly amazing :) anyways they landed safe and sound, and they'll only be coming back on monday.
        </p>

            we also have renovation going on at home; mis padres are getting their master bathroom re-done. the guys who are re-doing the bathroom are rlly nice; they renovated various parts of my home last year so it's nice seeing them again.
        </p>
        <p>
            because my dad and i are alone, we've decided to grab some indian food tonight (because neither of us can cook for our lives lol). im quite excited, we'll be picking up food from Bombay Walla, which is an Indian Street Food restaurant.
        </p>
        <p>
            tomorrow i'll be watching the new spider-man movie with a few friends. i've heard rlly good things abt the movie, and i hope it lives up to the hype it's recieving.
        </p>
        <p>
            i'd also thought i'd mention smn from yesterday: my mom was yelling at me to clean my room. so i did.
        </p>
        <p>
            in the process i found an old journal from october of 2020: the time in my life when i was applying to bca.
        </p>
        <p>
            and damn i had some big self-esteem issues. i literally used to talk to myself in there and attempt to hype myself up by saying things like "isha you are good enough. who is saying you aren't good enough? only you! so shut it :imp:"
        </p>
        <p>
            i'm glad i made it out of that dark time in my life. the next hell stop will be junior yr :)
        </p>
        <p>
            at least i got all my classes that i requested. and i also have some v fun and exciting ecs. but still, it'll be mad chaotic.
        </p>
        <p>
            i think im done venting for now. woof woof.
