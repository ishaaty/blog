        <h1>4/11/23 - beginning of spring break</h1>
        <p>
            hello
        </p>
        <p>
            4 months later! funny thing is, i explored my past blog posts with a friend towards the end of march, and was thinking of writing a post.
            never got to do it then, so i'll do it now.
        </p>
        <p>
            i had been looking forward to spring break since february. so glad it's finally here!
        </p>
        <p>
            i just came back from my trip to massachusetts; i spent about 2 days there with some friends and family. while it was very short, i had a great time and forgot about my life here in NJ.
        </p>
        <p>
            as for today, i didn't feel like doing anything. i tried studying for my ap cs exam that's coming up in may, but i had 0 motivation to do so. i ended up chatting with the guy who takes care of my pool, and his wife.
        </p>
        <p>
            after talking with them, i asked my mom to take me to town to get bagels for lunch. but because there was a large truck in my driveway (for cleaning the pool), my mom couldn't get her car out of the garage. i then decided to walk to town to get lunch for myself. 
        </p>
        <p>
            it was about a 10 minute walk to the downtown. there is a new chipotle in my town, and i was contemplating going there instead, but i desperately needed my soul food.
        </p>
        <p>
            i arrived at my favorite bagel shop and bought a snapple and plain bagel w/ chicken salad. i ate at the town park, while enjoying the peaceful weather.
        </p>
        <p>
            it was around 2.30 pm when i finished eating, and i had an impulsive idea to walk to my middle school. it's only 2 minutes away from where i was, and school was about to end in 15 minutes. not to mention i could find my sister there as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            i sat on the bleachers outside the school and finished watching "jab we met" on my phone. i had started watching it on the way back from MA, but never finished it.
        </p>
        <p>
            and within 15 minutes, children were flooding out of the school building. i was roaming around outside, seeing if i could find any of my old teachers (and my sis ofc). i ended up seeing my choir teacher (who didn't remember me) and a math teacher i wish i had lmao.
        </p>
        <p>
            my sister had some after school meeting, so i decided to go back to the park where i ate lunch. as i was walking, there was a group of middle school girls behind my loudly gossiping about a group of boys they know and their new girlfriends. i recall the girls behind me were talking crap about one girl in particular: about how she is really ugly and has a weird laugh. they had pictures and everything. bruh.
        </p>
        <p>
            i arrived back at the park and found my sister. apparently she was trailing behind me because her meeting got canceled. and i had no clue. we were waiting for my mom to pick us up, and i got this picture of the train tracks before she came:

        <p>
            mother came after 10 minutes, and she dropped me off at work.
        </p>
        <p>
            i work for a tutoring company. typically everyday is the same as the last, but today my boss gave us tablets! it was very convienient, because rather than having to use our bulky solution books to help students, we could the tablets instead for an easy viewing experience.
        </p>

            andd that's pretty much it. see u again in another 4 months.
